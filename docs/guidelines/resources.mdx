# Resources

Rest resources represent your business domain. They are modelled as nouns. For example, if you are developing a blog RestAPI, you will have `blog`, `post`, `comment`, `user`, `tag` and so on.
If you are in an e-commerce domain, you will have `category`, `order`, `product` and so on.

There are two types of resources: `collections` and `singletons`.

Collections are a way of grouping resources of the same type, for example `users` (grouped `user` type resources) or `posts` (`post` type resources).

A resource that lives outside a collection is called a `singleton` resource. An example of a `singleton` resource would be a `profile`.

Collections can "live" at the top of your APIs and/or be nested within a resource. For example, you can have a `books` collection resource at the root of your API (listing all the books), but also a `/users/:user/books` collection sub-resource
(books that belong to a particular user).

### URL Structure

Each resource has its own URL. URLs are organized hierarchically. At the root of your API you will have `/` URL,
where you can list all available collections and singletons. You can also add some API metadata, like versioning, some operational status, etc.
One example of how it may look like:

```bash title="GET https://api.acme.com/"
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' https://api.acme.com/
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "status": "ok",
  "collections": [
    "users",
    "posts",
    "comments"
  ],
  "singletons": [
    "profile"
  ]
}
```

`users` collection can be accessed via `https://api.acme.com/users` URL. `profile` singleton can be accessed via `https://api.acme.com/profile` URL.

Sub-resources (e.g `books` belonging to a `user`) can be accessed via `https://api.acme.com/users/:user/books` URL.

### HTTP Methods

The most commonly used HTTP methods are:

| Method  | Scope        | Description                                |
|---------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| GET     | `collection` | List all resources in a collection         |
| GET     | `resource`   | Get a single resource                      |
| HEAD    | `collection` | Same as GET, but without the response body |
| HEAD    | `resource`   | Same as GET, but without the response body |
| POST    | `collection` | Create a new resource                      |
| PUT     | `resource`   | Update a resource                          |
| PATCH   | `resource`   | Partially update a resource                |
| DELETE  | `resource`   | Delete a resource                          |
| OPTIONS | `any`        | Get information about the resource         |

:::tip
* `HEAD` method can give you the same info you would get from `GET`, but without the response body. This is useful
for getting caching info, content-type and other headers, etc.
* `OPTIONS` method provides info about which methods are available on a resource.
:::

The basic idea is to try to map your business events to URLs and HTTP methods. For instance, a business event of **registering a new user** would
map to a `POST` request to the `users` collection resource. A business event of **deleting a user account** would map to a `DELETE` request to the `users` collection resource.

:::tip Actions
In cases you can't map your business events to URLs and HTTP methods, you can use `actions`.
The author of [such approach](https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/methods.html#actions) proposes having `actions` sub-resource (either on resource or collection level), where RPC-like messages cane be POSTed to.

An example could look like:

```bash title="Sending an email to a user via an action"
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -x POST https://api.acme.com/users/123/actions -d '{
  "type": "SEND_EMAIL",
  "payload": {
    "subject": "Welcome to Acme!",
    "body": "..."
  }
}'
```

On the implementation side, you need to implement a handler able to process polymorphic messages.

The `actions` approach should be used with caution, as if it's heavily used it can signify that your API is not well-designed, or better fits RPC approach.

### Resource representation

Rest stands for **Representational State Transfer**. This means that application domain data is managed by the client and the server by means of transferring data representations,
via HTTP methods and URLs. Rest, itself, does not define any specific data format. Clients and servers need to agree on a data format that works for both.

However, `JSON` has become the de-facto standard for data exchange between clients and servers. It is a lightweight, machine and human-readable, and easy to parse data format.
It is also versatile enough to represent well any complex data structures.
