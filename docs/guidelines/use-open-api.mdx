# Use OpenAPI

[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) is a human and machine-readable specification for describing, producing and consuming REST APIs.
It provides a common understanding of the API for both the producer and consumer.

It is a community accepted standard, with massive adoption and tooling support (client and server code generation, documentation, testing, mocking, etc).

It offers a concise way to describe endpoints, parameters, requests and responses, security, and [more](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#version-3-1-0).
Technically, it is a `JSON` or `YAML` file that describes the API.

An example of an OpenAPI specification for an API for user management (saving and reading users):

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Simple API overview
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Returns a list of users.
      responses:
        '200':
          description: A JSON array of user names
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
    post:
      summary: Create a user
      requestBody:
        description: User to be created
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: User created
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
        default:
          description: unexpected error
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Error'
```

On the other hand, OpenAPI comes with a learning curve, in case of complex APIs it can get verbose (can be solved by using external files for common definitions).
The specification is tied to REST APIs, meaning that if you have a GraphQL, gRPC or WebSocket API, you may have difficulties to describe it with OpenAPI.
