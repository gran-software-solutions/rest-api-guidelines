# Use links (Hypermedia)

Links are rarely used, but a very powerful feature of an API. According to the Richardson Maturity Model, they
represent the final stage of maturity. They:

* Allow you to navigate the API
* Can transform your API to a state machine (more on that soon)
* Remove the logic on how to build links from the client (more on that soon)

:::caution
Links only make sense **if your clients plan to use them**. If you don't plan to use them, don't provide them,
since this is a **significant implementation burden** on the server side.

## How to implement links?

Unfortunately, there is no standard for links in REST APIs. There are several ways to implement them ([HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html),
[JSON LD](https://json-ld.org/) and more). The most libraries use the HAL format, so we will use it as an example.

### HAL

HAL provides two types of links: **_embedded** and **_links**. Let's see how to use them:

```http
GET /users/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.acme.com
Accept: application/hal+json

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "id": 1,
    "username": "john",
    "email": "john@doe.com"
    "_embedded": {
        "orders": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "total": 100,
                "_links": {
                    "self": {
                        "href": "https://api.acme.com/users/1/orders/1"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "https://api.acme.com/users/1"
        },
        "orders": {
            "href": "https://api.acme.com/users/1/orders"
        }
    }
}
```
In the example given, we have a user with an embedded list of orders. The user has a link to his orders, and each order has a link to itself.

### Link header

Another (less flexible way) to implement links is to use the `Link` [header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/http/headers/link)
This approach is more aligned with HTTP standard, but it is less flexible and less common. We advise you **not to use it**.

## Links as a state machine

**TODO**

## Links for API discovery

`GET /`

**TODO**
