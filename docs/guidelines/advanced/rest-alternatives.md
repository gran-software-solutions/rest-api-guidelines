# REST alternatives

**TODO**

## REST vs gRPC

* Guidelines vs. Rules:

  REST is a set of guidelines for designing web APIs without enforcing anything. On the other hand, gRPC enforces rules by defining a .proto file that must be adhered to by both client and server for data exchange1.
* Underlying HTTP Protocol:

  REST provides a request-response communication model built on the HTTP 1.1 protocol. Therefore, when multiple requests reach the server, it is bound to handle each of them one at a time. However, gRPC follows a client-response model of communication for designing web APIs that rely on HTTP/2. Hence, gRPC allows streaming communication and serves multiple requests simultaneously1.
* Data Exchange Format:

  REST typically uses JSON and XML formats for data transfer. However, gRPC relies on Protobuf for an exchange of data over the HTTP/2 protocol1.
* Serialization vs. Strong Typing:

  REST requires serialization and conversion into the target programming language for both client and server using JSON or XML which increases response time and possibility of errors while parsing request/response. However, gRPC provides strongly typed messages automatically converted using Protobuf exchange format to chosen programming language1.
* Latency:

  REST utilizing HTTP 1.1 requires a TCP handshake for each request which can suffer from latency issues. On the other hand, gRPC relies on HTTP/2 protocol which uses multiplexed streams allowing several clients to send multiple requests simultaneously without establishing new TCP connection for each one1.
* Browser Support:

  REST APIs on HTTP 1.1 have universal browser support while gRPC has limited browser support because numerous browsers have no mature support for HTTP/2 so it may require gRPC-web and proxy layer to perform conversions between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP/22.

## REST vs GraphQL

Data Control: GraphQL gives you more control over your data since it allows you to request exactly what you need in a single query1.
Speed & Efficiency: REST APIs can be faster and more efficient since they can quickly return large amounts of data1.
Data Modeling: In a REST API, the server defines the data model and endpoints that represent that data while in GraphQL, the client defines the data model and server provides data based on clientâ€™s query2.
Caching: In a REST API, client can cache response for particular endpoint to avoid making multiple requests to server while caching with GraphQL is more complex due to its flexible nature2.
