# Reading REST Resources

Reading REST resources is performed by sending a `GET` request to a `URI` under which the resource is located.
The format of the response depends on the `Accept` header of the request. This process of agreeing on the format of the
response is called content negotiation.[^1]

There is no difference between retrieving a single resource and retrieving a collection of resources. The only difference
is the URI under which the resource is located.

<TabItem value="singleton" label="Reading a singleton resource">

```http
GET /posts/1 HTTP/1.1
HOST: api.acme.com
Accept: application/json

200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "How to do REST APIs",
    "content": "Foo bar..."
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="collection" label="Reading a collection resource">

```http
GET /posts HTTP/1.1
HOST: api.acme.com
Accept: application/json

200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "count": 2,
    "items": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "How to do REST APIs",
            "content": "Foo bar..."
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "title": "How to do REST APIs",
            "content": "Foo bar..."
        }
    ]
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution
In case of a collection resource retrieval, make sure that pagination is used. This is to prevent both the server and the client from being overloaded with a large number of resources.

## Improving performance and reducing server load

In many cases, APIs are read-heavy. This can (depending on a scale) put burden on the server. To improve performance, and reduce the load on the server, use [caching](/docs/guidelines/advanced/caching-responses)
