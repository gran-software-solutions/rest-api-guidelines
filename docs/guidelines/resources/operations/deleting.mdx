# Deleting REST Resources
Deleting REST resources is accomplished by sending a `DELETE` request to the resource's `URI`.

As `DELETE` is considered an idempotent method (more [here](/docs/guidelines/advanced/idemptency-and-safety)), it's safe to send multiple requests. It's important to note that
the response status may change from `204 No Content` for the initial call, to `404 Not Found` for subsequent calls.
An example of a `DELETE` request is shown below:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="initial 204" label="Initial DELETE">

```http
DELETE /posts/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.acme.com
Accept: application/json

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="subsequent-404" label="Subsequent DELETE">

```http
DELETE /posts/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.acme.com
Accept: application/json

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
