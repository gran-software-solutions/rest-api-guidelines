# Retrieving REST Resources

Retrieving REST resources is performed by sending a `GET` request to a `URI` under which the resource is located.
The format of the response depends on the `Accept` header of the request. This process of agreeing on the format of the
response is called content negotiation.[^1]

There is no difference between retrieving a single resource and retrieving a collection of resources. The only difference
is the URI under which the resource is located.

{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "How to do REST APIs",
    "content": "Foo bar..."
}
```

        {

            "content": "Foo bar..."
        },

            "id": 2,

            "content": "Foo bar..."
        }
    ]
}

## Improving performance and reducing server load

In many cases, APIs are read-heavy. This can (depending on a scale) put burden on the server. To improve performance, and reduce the load on the server, use [caching](/docs/guidelines/advanced/caching-responses)
