# Retrieving REST Resources

Retrieving REST resources is performed by sending a `GET` request to a `URI` under which the resource is located.
The format of the response depends on the `Accept` header of the request. This process of agreeing on the format of the
response is called content negotiation.[^1]

There is no difference between retrieving a single resource and retrieving a collection of resources. The only difference
is the URI under which the resource is located.

:::tip Caching
In many cases, APIs are read-heavy. To improve performance, and reduce the load on the server, use [caching](/docs/guidelines/advanced/caching-responses)
