# Specify the data you need - `select`

To be able to design for flexibility, we need ability to specify the shape of the data needed. From case to case, the clients of our APIs
will need different data. To account for this, we propose using `select` query parameter.

Let's come up with an example. Say we have a `user` resource. The `JSON` representation of a user looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@doe.com"
}
```

The simplest case of `select` would be to specify the fields we want to get back. For example, if we want to get only the `id` and `name` fields, we would do:

```bash title="Selected base user fields"
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' https://api.acme.com/users/123?select=id,name
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

Let's suppose we want to include the related `posts` of the user. A `post` resource looks like this:

```json title="Sample post"
{
  "id": "456",
  "title": "My first post",
  "body": "This is my first post"
}
```

Let's imagine we want, on top of previous example, to get the `id` and `title` of the `posts` of the user. We would do:

```bash title="Selected additional related fields"
curl -H 'Accept: application/json' https://api.acme.com/users/123?select=id,name,posts.id,posts.title
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "id":"123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "456",
      "title": "My first post"
    }
  ]
}
```
