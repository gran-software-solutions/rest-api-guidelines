# Use OpenAPI

[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) is a human and machine-readable (`JSON` or `YAML` format) specification for describing REST APIs.

It is a community accepted standard, with massive adoption and tooling support (client and server code generation, documentation, testing, mocking, etc).

It offers a concise way to describe endpoints, parameters, requests and responses, security, and [more](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#version-3-1-0).
