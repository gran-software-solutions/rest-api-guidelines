## OpenAPI Specification

The final OpenAPI specification will look like this:

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="OpenAPI specification">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>

## Q&A

### What are some other options for uploading files?

### How about large files?

[^1]: We also need to support filtering by description, and tags
