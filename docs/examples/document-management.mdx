# Document Management API

## Introduction

Let's create an API for managing documents. We will be able to:

* Upload a document
  * Alongside binary data, we will also be able to send metadata:
    * Description as a string
    * Tags as a list of strings
* List all uploaded documents
* Download a document
* Retrieve metadata of a document
* Update metadata of a document
* Delete a document

## OpenAPI Specification 2

The final OpenAPI specification will look like this:

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title="OpenAPI specification">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>

## Q&A

### What are some other options for uploading files?

### How about large files?
