Welcome to GRAN Software Solutions Rest API guidelines.

The idea behind this Website is to provide a set of guidelines for development of REST APIs.

The content is organized in the following sections:

* [**Web APIs Fundamentals**](/docs/web-apis-fundamentals): A page that describes basic principles to think about when designing a REST API
* [**Examples**](/docs/category/examples): A set of hypothetical examples that demonstrate how to apply the guidelines
* [**Guidelines**](/docs/category/guidelines): A set of guidelines that describe how to design REST APIs
* [**References**](/docs/references): A set of links to external resources that influenced our guidelines
