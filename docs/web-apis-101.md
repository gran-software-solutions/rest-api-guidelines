# Web APIs 101

## Core design principles

### Platform independence

REST APIs are designed to work across different platforms because they use standard protocols like `HTTP` and `HTTPS`. They communicate using common data exchange formats like `JSON` and `XML`.
`JSON` is more commonly used because it’s lightweight and easy to read.

REST APIs are stateless, meaning the server doesn’t store client state. This makes it easy to scale them by adding
more servers. Overall, REST APIs allow systems developed with different technologies to communicate seamlessly and are easy to scale.
