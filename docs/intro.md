Welcome to GRAN Software Solutions Rest API guidelines.

## How is the content organized?

The idea behind this Website is to provide a set of guidelines for the development of REST APIs. The content is organized in the following sections:

* [**Examples**](/docs/category/examples): A set of hypothetical examples that demonstrate how to apply the guidelines
* [**Guidelines**](/docs/category/guidelines): A set of guidelines that describe how to design REST APIs
